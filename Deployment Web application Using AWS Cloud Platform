1. Create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC service.
     - Click on "Create VPC" and provide the following details:
          - VPC name: e.g., "ELC-VPC"
          - IPv4 CIDR block: "0.0.0.0/16"
          - Tenancy: "Default"
       - Click "Create VPC" to proceed.

2. Create Subnets:
    - In the VPC dashboard, click on "Subnets" in the left-hand menu.
    - Click "Create subnet" and provide the following details:
           - VPC: Select the VPC you just created.
           - Availability Zone: Choose an appropriate Availability Zone.
           - IPv4 CIDR block: "10.0.1.0/24" (for the public subnet)
     - Repeat the process to create a private subnet with CIDR block "10.0.2.0/24".

3. Create Route Tables:
   - In the VPC dashboard, click on "Route Tables" in the left-hand menu.
   - Click "Create route table" and provide the following details:
      - VPC: Select the VPC you created.
      - Name tag: "Public Route Table"
   - Repeat the process to create a private route table.

4. Associate Subnets with Route Tables:
   - In the "Route Tables" section, select the public route table.
   - Click on the "Subnet Associations" tab and click "Edit subnet associations".
   - Select the public subnet and click "Save associations".
   - Repeat the process to associate the private subnet with the private route table.

5. Create an Internet Gateway:
   - In the VPC dashboard, click on "Internet Gateways" in the left-hand menu.
   - Click "Create internet gateway" and provide a name tag.
   - Select the created internet gateway and click "Actions" > "Attach to VPC".
   - Choose the VPC you created and click "Attach internet gateway".

6. Deploy the Frontend Application:
    - In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk service.
    - Click "Create a new application" and provide the following details:
        - Application name: "ELC-Frontend"
        - Platform: Choose the appropriate platform for your frontend application (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).

7. Set up the CodePipeline for Continuous Deployment:
    - In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the CodePipeline service.
    - Click "Create pipeline" and provide the following details:
        - Pipeline name: "ELC-Frontend-Pipeline"
        - Source provider: Choose the appropriate source provider (e.g., GitHub, CodeCommit, etc.).
              -  https://github.com/suryaprakash0802/Python-AWS-RDS.git
        - Destination: Select the Elastic Beanstalk environment you created for the frontend.

8. Deploy the Backend Application:
      - In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 service.
      - Click "Launch instance" and provide the following details:
            - Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Choose an appropriate AMI for your backend application (e.g., Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu, etc.).
            - Instance type: Select an appropriate instance type for your workload.
            - Network: Choose the VPC you created.
            - Subnet: Select the public subnet.
      - Launch the instance and connect to it using the Fleet Manager remote desktop.
      - Install Python on the instance and clone the backend application repository from GitHub.
      - Modify the backend application code to connect to the database.

9. Deploy the Database:
    - In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the RDS service.
    - Click "Create database" and provide the following details:
        - Database creation method: "Standard create"
        - Engine type: Choose the appropriate database engine (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
        - DB instance class: Select an appropriate instance class for your workload.
        - Connectivity: Choose the VPC you created and the private subnet.
    - Connect to the RDS instance from the backend EC2 instance using the PostgreSQL client (pgAdmin) and create a table with sample data.

10. Integrate the Frontend and Backend:
      - Update the frontend application code to use the correct URL for the backend API.
      - Commit the changes to the frontend repository, which will trigger the CodePipeline to deploy the updated application.
      - Verify the end-to-end functionality by accessing the frontend application and ensuring it can retrieve data from the backend API and the RDS database.

This is a complete solution demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a scalable and secure application architecture on AWS, 
leveraging various services such as VPC, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline, and RDS. It highlights the importance of network isolation, 
continuous deployment, and secure database integration in a cloud-based environment.
