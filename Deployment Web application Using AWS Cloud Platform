[ Go to the AWS Managment Console ]

1.	Create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
   •	Create a new VPC with a CIDR block of 0.0.0.0/16.
   •	Create two subnets within the VPC:
     •	Public subnet with CIDR 10.0.1.0/24
     •	Private subnet with CIDR 10.0.2.0/24

2.	Configure Routing Tables:
    •	Create a public route table and associate it with the public subnet.
    •	Create a private route table and associate it with the private subnet.
    •	Add an Internet Gateway to the VPC to enable internet connectivity for the public subnet.

3.	Deploy the Frontend Application:
    •	Launch an Elastic Beanstalk environment to host the frontend application.
    •	Set up a CodePipeline to enable continuous deployment of the frontend application from a GitHub repository.

4.	Deploy the Backend Application:
    •	Launch an EC2 instance in the public subnet to host the backend application.
    •	Connect to the EC2 instance using the Fleet Manager remote desktop.
    •	Install Python on the EC2 instance and clone the backend application repository from GitHub.
           - https://github.com/suryaprakash0802/Python-AWS-RDS.git 
    •	Modify the backend application code to connect to the database.

5.	Deploy the Database:
    •	Launch an RDS (Relational Database Service) instance in the private subnet.
    •	Configure the RDS instance to use the VPC and the security group created earlier.
    •	Connect to the RDS instance from the backend EC2 instance using the PostgreSQL client (pgAdmin).
    •	Create a table in the database and insert some sample data.

6.	Integrate the Frontend and Backend:
    •	Update the frontend application code to use the correct URL for the backend API.
    •	Deploy the updated frontend application to the Elastic Beanstalk environment using the CodePipeline.
    •	Verify the end-to-end functionality by accessing the frontend application and ensuring it can retrieve data from the backend API and the RDS database.

This is a complete solution demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a scalable and secure application architecture on AWS, 
leveraging various services such as VPC, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline, and RDS. It highlights the importance of network isolation, 
continuous deployment, and secure database integration in a cloud-based environment.
