# Kubernetes Deployment for Microservices

This project involves deploying a multi-node Kubernetes cluster on AWS EC2 instances and orchestrating containers to host a microservices-based application. 
The deployment includes troubleshooting network issues and optimizing resource allocation.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS Account: You need an AWS account to create EC2 instances.
2. AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine.
3. kubectl: Install kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool.
4. eksctl: Install eksctl, a tool to create and manage Kubernetes clusters on Amazon EKS.

## Setup Instructions

1. **AWS EC2 Instances:**
   - Launch AWS EC2 instances for your Kubernetes nodes. Ensure instances have the necessary IAM roles and permissions.

2. **Kubernetes Cluster:**
   - Use eksctl to create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS. 

     eksctl create cluster --name my-cluster --node-type t2.micro --nodes 2
     ```

3. **Microservices Application:**
   - Deploy your microservices-based application to the Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes manifests (YAML files).

4. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you encounter network issues or need to troubleshoot, check the logs using kubectl logs and describe pods/services.

5. **Resource Optimization:**
   - Optimize resource allocation for your microservices pods. Update resource requests and limits in the Kubernetes manifests.

## Directory Structure

- `/k8s`: Contains Kubernetes manifests for deploying microservices.
- `/scripts`: Includes any scripts used for deployment or troubleshooting.
- `/docs`: Documentation and additional resources.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to deploy and run the microservices application on the Kubernetes cluster.
