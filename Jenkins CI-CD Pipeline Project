# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application

## Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for a web application using Jenkins. 
The pipeline is set up to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the web application.
Git is used for version control, and AWS is the target deployment environment.

## Key Features

- Automated build and deployment process.
- Integration with Git for version control.
- Deployment to AWS for continuous integration.
- Identification and resolution of build and deployment failures.
- Ensures continuous integration and delivery of the web application.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Jenkins Server: Set up a Jenkins server with the necessary plugins installed.

2. Git: Install Git for version control.

3. AWS Account: Have an AWS account with the required permissions for deploying the web application.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Surajshakywal/DevOpsClassCodes.git
   cd DevOpsClassCodes

2. Jenkins Configuration:

Set up a new Jenkins job to create the CI/CD pipeline.
Configure Jenkins credentials for Git and AWS access.

3. AWS Configuration:

Set up AWS credentials in Jenkins.
Ensure the necessary AWS services (e.g., S3, EC2) are properly configured.

4. Jenkinsfile:

Customize the Jenkinsfile to match your project structure.
Update AWS deployment configurations.

5. Web Application:

Ensure the web application source code is compatible with the CI/CD pipeline.
Include necessary configuration files (e.g., Dockerfile, package.json).

6. Triggering the Pipeline:

Manually trigger the pipeline for the first run.
Set up webhooks or periodic builds for automatic triggering.

{Pipeline Stages}

1. The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

- Checkout: Retrieve the latest version of the code from the Git repository.

- Build: Build the web application artifacts.

- Test: Run tests to ensure code quality.

- Deploy to AWS: Deploy the application to the AWS environment.

{Troubleshooting}
If there are issues with the CI/CD pipeline, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Check Jenkins job console output for error messages.
- Verify AWS credentials and permissions.
- Review the Jenkinsfile for misconfigurations.
